//
//	----->
//	This can
//	be solved
//
//	by o(n2) by using 2 for loops and innner for loop will check for the (sum-i) element every time.
//
//		----> We can also save the array element in an HashMap and then we can search for the sum-i, 
//		this time because we don't need extra for loop to check the sum-i, this solution gives
//
//	us o(n).
//
//		----> we can also follow two pointer approach, 1st pointer is at starting of the array and 
//		second is at the end of the array,, we will keep check we sum of 1stP+endP = sum then that's the pair, 
//		if sum is greater then we decrease the end pointer or if sum is less then we increase the first pointer.o(nlogn),
//		because we need tp sort the array.
